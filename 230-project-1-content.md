# Cheese Shooter
#### Created by Matt Hovey

## I. Concept
The game is like the old school Mario you know and love...but with a deadly cheese twist. You play as
a humble mouse trying to fight for the glory of cheese at the end of each level.

## II.Genre
The game will be a sidescrolling platforming shooter so it would be classified under the genre of an action platformer.
Different types of enemies will be coming at you on screen that have different abilities.

## III.Platform
This game will be for desktops and laptops

## IV.Story
You are a mouse that is going through different parts of your home within a humans house trying to get
as much cheese as you can before you reach the end of the level and shooting enemies that are in the mousehole with your watergun.
The mood of the game will be light hearted and goofy even for the goal of the game.

## V.Esthetics
The game will be in 8 or 16bit style with matching music and there will be sounds for jumps, shooting, damage, and deaths.

## VI.Gameplay
The game will be played with arrow keys for movement and jumping, and the spacebar will be used for shooting the watergun. The main mechanics of the game will be these as well, jumping, movement, and shooting.

## VII.Screenshots
(Will be inputted at a later date).
